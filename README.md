# Robot_2WD_PyGame
This program is a simulation of a robot moving in a graphical environment. It utilizes the Pygame library to display the simulation on the screen.

The robot is represented by a blue circle, with a green wheel on the left and a red wheel on the right. The robot's coordinates, speed, and orientation are updated at each iteration of the program's main loop.

The robot can move by adjusting the angular speed of its left and right wheels. Based on these angular speeds, the linear speeds of the wheels are calculated, determining the robot's speed and direction of movement in the environment. The radius of the wheels and the spacing between them are also taken into account in the calculations.

The user can resize the simulation window using the mouse. The escape key allows exiting the simulation, and the F12 key toggles fullscreen mode.

This program provides a basic foundation for a mobile robot simulation, where you can experiment with the robot's parameters and observe its movement behavior on the screen.
